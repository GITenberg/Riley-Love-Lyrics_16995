<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In midnight banks of bud and flower</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Beneath my lady's lattice-bower.</span><br />
<br />
And there, drenched with the teary dews,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'd woo her with such wondrous art</span><br />
As well might stanch the songs that ooze<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Out of the mockbird's breaking heart;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">So light, so tender, and so sweet</span><br />

<p>
As one who cons at evening o'er an album all alone,<br />
And muses on the faces of the friends that he has known,<br />
So I turn the leaves of fancy till, in shadowy design,<br />
I find the smiling features of an old sweetheart of mine.<br />
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

</p>

<p>
The lamplight seems to glimmer with a flicker of surprise,<br />
As I turn it low to rest me of the dazzle in my eyes,<br />
And light my pipe in silence, save a sigh that seems to yoke<br />
Its fate with my tobacco and to vanish with the smoke.<br />
<br />
'Tis a fragrant retrospection&mdash;for the loving thoughts that start<br />
Into being are like perfume from the blossom of the heart;<br />
And to dream the old dreams over is a luxury divine&mdash;<br />
When my truant fancy wanders with that old sweetheart of mine.<br />
<br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">   [Pg 25]</a></span>
Though I hear, beneath my study, like a fluttering of wings,<br />
The voices of my children, and the mother as she sings,<br />
I feel no twinge of conscience to deny me any theme<br />
When Care has cast her anchor in the harbor of a dream.<br />
<br />

<p>
In fact, to speak in earnest, I believe it adds a charm<br />
To spice the good a trifle with a little dust of harm&mdash;<br />
For I find an extra flavor in Memory's mellow wine<br />
That makes me drink the deeper to that old sweetheart of mine.<br />

<p>
A face of lily-beauty, with a form of airy grace,<br />
Floats out of my tobacco as the genii from the vase;<br />
And I thrill beneath the glances of a pair of azure eyes<br />
As glowing as the summer and as tender as the skies.<br />
<br />
I can see the pink sunbonnet and the little checkered dress<br />
She wore when first I kissed her and she answered the caress<br />
With the written declaration that, "as surely as the vine<br />
Grew round the stump," she loved me&mdash;that old sweetheart of mine.<br />

<p>
And again I feel the pressure of her slender little hand,<br />
As we used to talk together of the future we had planned&mdash;<br />
When I should be a poet, and with nothing else to do<br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"> [Pg 28]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"> [Pg 29]</a></span>
But write the tender verses that she set the music to:<br />
<br />
When we should live together in a cozy little cot<br />
Hid in a nest of roses, with a fairy garden-spot,<br />
Where the vines were ever fruited, and the weather ever fine,<br />
And the birds were ever singing for that old sweetheart of mine:<br />
</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/image025.jpg" width="350" height="170" alt="(untitled image)" title="(untitled image)" />
</p>

<p>
When I should be her lover forever and a day,<br />
And she my faithful sweetheart till the golden hair was gray;<br />
And we should be so happy that when either's lips were dumb<br />
They would not smile in Heaven till the other's kiss had come.

But, ah! my dream is broken by a step upon the stair,<br />
And the door is softly opened, and&mdash;my wife is standing there;<br />
Yet with eagerness and rapture all my visions I resign<br />
To greet the living presence of that old sweetheart of mine.<br />

<p>
It's the curiousest thing in creation,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whenever I hear that old song</span><br />
"Do They Miss Me at Home," I'm so bothered,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My life seems as short as it's long!&mdash;</span><br />
Fer ev'rything 'pears like adzackly<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It 'peared in the years past and gone,&mdash;</span><br />
When I started out sparkin', at twenty,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And had my first neckercher on!</span><br />
<br />
Though I'm wrinkelder, older and grayer<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Right now than my parents was then,</span><br />
You strike up that song "Do They Miss Me,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I'm jest a youngster again!&mdash;</span><br />
I'm a-standin' back thare in the furries<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A-wishin' fer evening to come,</span><br />
And a-whisperin' over and over<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Them words "Do They Miss Me at Home?"</span><br />
<br />
You see, <i>Marthy Ellen she</i> sung it<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The first time I heerd it; and so,</span><br />
As she was my very first sweetheart,<br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"> [Pg 32]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It reminds me of her, don't you know;&mdash;</span><br />
How her face used to look, in the twilight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As I tuck her to Spellin'; and she</span><br />
Kep' a-hummin' that song tel I ast her,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pine-blank, ef she ever missed <i>me</i>!</span><br />
<br />
I can shet my eyes now, as you sing it,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And hear her low answerin' words;</span><br />
And then the glad chirp of the crickets,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As clear as the twitter of birds;</span><br />
And the dust in the road is like velvet,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the ragweed and fennel and grass</span><br />
Is as sweet as the scent of the lilies<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Eden of old, as we pass.</span><br />
<br />
"<i>Do They Miss Me at Home?</i>" Sing it lower&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And softer&mdash;and sweet as the breeze</span><br />
That powdered our path with the snowy<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">White bloom of the old locus'-trees!</span><br />
Let the whipperwills he'p you to sing it,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the echoes 'way over the hill,</span><br />
Tel the moon boolges out, in a chorus<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of stars, and our voices is still.</span><br />

How tired I am! I sink down all alone<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Here by the wayside of the Present. Lo,</span><br />
Even as a child I hide my face and moan&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A little girl that may no farther go;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The path above me only seems to grow</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">More rugged, climbing still, and ever briered</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With keener thorns of pain than these below;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And O the bleeding feet that falter so</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And are so very tired!</span><br />
<br />
Why, I have journeyed from the far-off Lands<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Babyhood&mdash;where baby-lilies blew</span><br />
Their trumpets in mine ears, and filled my hands<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With treasures of perfume and honey-dew,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And where the orchard shadows ever drew</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Their cool arms round me when my cheeks were fired</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With too much joy, and lulled mine eyelids to,</span><br />

That quenched itself in roses suddenly,<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Poor moth!&mdash;Along my wavering flight toward fame</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The winds drive backward, and my wings are lame</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And broken, bruised and tired!</span><br />
<br />
I hardly know the path from those old times;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I know at first it was a smoother one</span><br />
Than this that hurries past me now, and climbs<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So high, its far cliffs even hide the sun</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And shroud in gloom my journey scarce begun.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I could not do quite all I should have done,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in my eagerness I have outrun</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">My strength&mdash;and I am tired....</span><br />
<br />
Just tired! But when of old I had the stay<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of mother-hands, O very sweet indeed</span><br />
It was to dream that all the weary way<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I should but follow where I now must lead&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For long ago they left me in my need,</span><br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"> [Pg 39]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And, groping on alone, I tripped and mired</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Among rank grasses where the serpents breed</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In knotted coils about the feet of speed.&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">There first it was I tired.</span><br />
<br />
And yet I staggered on, and bore my load<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Right gallantly: The sun, in summer-time,</span><br />
In lazy belts came slipping down the road<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To woo me on, with many a glimmering rhyme</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rained from the golden rim of some fair clime,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That, hovering beyond the clouds, inspired</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My failing heart with fancies so sublime</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I half forgot my path of dust and grime,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Though I was growing tired.</span><br />
<br />
And there were many voices cheering me:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I listened to sweet praises where the wind</span><br />
Went laughing o'er my shoulders gleefully<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And scattering my love-songs far behind;&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Until, at last, I thought the world so kind&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">So rich in all my yearning soul desired&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So generous&mdash;so loyally inclined,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I grew to love and trust it.... I was blind&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Yea, blind as I was tired!</span><br />
<br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"> [Pg 40]</a></span>
And yet one hand held me in creature-touch:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And O, how fair it was, how true and strong,</span><br />
How it did hold my heart up like a crutch,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till, in my dreams, I joyed to walk along</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The toilsome way, contented with a song&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Twas all of earthly things I had acquired,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And 'twas enough, I feigned, or right or wrong,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Since, binding me to man&mdash;a mortal thong&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">It stayed me, growing tired....</span><br />
<br />
Yea, I had e'en resigned me to the strait<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of earthly rulership&mdash;had bowed my head</span><br />
Acceptant of the master-mind&mdash;the great<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One lover&mdash;lord of all,&mdash;the perfected</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Kiss-comrade of my soul;&mdash;had stammering said</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">My prayers to him;&mdash;all&mdash;all that he desired</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I rendered sacredly as we were wed.&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nay&mdash;nay!&mdash;'twas but a myth I worshipp&eacute;d.&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And&mdash;God of love!&mdash;how tired!</span><br />

For, O my friends, to lose the latest grasp&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To feel the last hope slipping from its hold&mdash;</span><br />
To feel the one fond hand within your clasp<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fall slack, and loosen with a touch so cold</span><br />

<br />
And I must rest.&mdash;Yet do not say "She <i>died</i>,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In speaking of me, sleeping here alone.</span><br />
I kiss the grassy grave I sink beside,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And close mine eyes in slumber all mine own:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hereafter I shall neither sob nor moan</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Nor murmur one complaint;&mdash;all I desired,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And failed in life to find, will now be known&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So let me dream. Good night! And on the stone</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Say simply: She was tired.</span><br />

He called her in from me and shut the door.<br />
And she so loved the sunshine and the sky!&mdash;<br />
She loved them even better yet than I<br />
That ne'er knew dearth of them&mdash;my mother dead,<br />
Nature had nursed me in her lap instead:<br />
And I had grown a dark and eerie child<br />
That rarely smiled,<br />
Save when, shut all alone in grasses high,<br />
Looking straight up in God's great lonesome sky<br />
And coaxing Mother to smile back on me.<br />
'Twas lying thus, this fair girl suddenly<br />
Came to me, nestled in the fields beside<br />
A pleasant-seeming home, with doorway wide&mdash;<br />
The sunshine beating in upon the floor<br />

<p>Like golden rain.&mdash;<br />
O sweet, sweet face above me, turn again<br />
And leave me! I had cried, but that an ache<br />
Within my throat so gripped it I could make<br />
No sound but a thick sobbing. Cowering so,<br />
I felt her light hand laid<br />
Upon my hair&mdash;a touch that ne'er before<br />
Had tamed me thus, all soothed and unafraid&mdash;<br />
It seemed the touch the children used to know<br />
When Christ was here, so dear it was&mdash;so dear,&mdash;<br />
At once I loved her as the leaves love dew<br />
In midmost summer when the days are new.<br />
Barely an hour I knew her, yet a curl<br />
Of silken sunshine did she clip for me<br />
Out of the bright May-morning of her hair,<br />
And bound and gave it to me laughingly,<br />
And caught my hands and called me "<i>Little girl</i>,"<br />
Tiptoeing, as she spoke, to kiss me there!<br />
And I stood dazed and dumb for very stress<br />
Of my great happiness.<br />
She plucked me by the gown, nor saw how mean<br />
The raiment&mdash;drew me with her everywhere:<br />
Smothered her face in tufts of grasses green:<br />
Put up her dainty hands and peeped between<br />
Her fingers at the blossoms&mdash;crooned and talked<br />
To them in strange, glad whispers, as we walked,&mdash;<br />
Said <i>this</i> one was her angel mother&mdash;<i>this</i>,<br />
Her baby-sister&mdash;come back, for a kiss,<br />
Clean from the Good-World!&mdash;smiled and kissed them, then<br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"> [Pg 54]</a></span>
Closed her soft eyes and kissed them o'er again.<br />
And so did she beguile me&mdash;so we played,&mdash;<br />
She was the dazzling Shine&mdash;I, the dark Shade&mdash;<br />
And we did mingle like to these, and thus,<br />
Together, made<br />
The perfect summer, pure and glorious.<br />
So blent we, till a harsh voice broke upon<br />
Our happiness.&mdash;She, startled as a fawn,<br />
Cried, "Oh, 'tis Father!"&mdash;all the blossoms gone<br />
From out her cheeks as those from out her grasp.&mdash;<br />
Harsher the voice came:&mdash;She could only gasp<br />
Affrightedly, "Good-bye!&mdash;good-bye! good-bye!"<br />
And lo, I stood alone, with that harsh cry<br />
Ringing a new and unknown sense of shame<br />
Through soul and frame,<br />
And, with wet eyes, repeating o'er and o'er,&mdash;<br />
"He called her in from me and shut the door!"<br />
</p>


<p class="center">II</p>

<p>
He called her in from me and shut the door!<br />
And I went wandering alone again&mdash;<br />
So lonely&mdash;O so very lonely then,<br />
I thought no little sallow star, alone<br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"> [Pg 55]</a></span>
In all a world of twilight, e'er had known<br />
Such utter loneliness. But that I wore<br />
Above my heart that gleaming tress of hair<br />
To lighten up the night of my despair,<br />
I think I might have groped into my grave<br />
Nor cared to wave<br />
The ferns above it with a breath of prayer.<br />
And how I hungered for the sweet, sweet face<br />
That bent above me in my hiding-place<br />
That day amid the grasses there beside<br />
Her pleasant home!&mdash;"Her <i>pleasant</i> home!" I sighed,<br />
Remembering;&mdash;then shut my teeth and feigned<br />
The harsh voice calling <i>me</i>,&mdash;then clinched my nails<br />
So deeply in my palms, the sharp wounds pained,<br />
And tossed my face toward heaven, as one who pales<br />
In splendid martyrdom, with soul serene,<br />
As near to God as high the guillotine.<br />
And I had <i>envied</i> her? Not that&mdash;O no!<br />
But I had longed for some sweet haven so!&mdash;<br />
Wherein the tempest-beaten heart might ride<br />
Sometimes at peaceful anchor, and abide<br />
Where those that loved me touched me with their hands,<br />
And looked upon me with glad eyes, and slipped<br />
Smooth fingers o'er my brow, and lulled the strands<br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"> [Pg 56]</a></span>
Of my wild tresses, as they backward tipped<br />
My yearning face and kissed it satisfied.<br />
Then bitterly I murmured as before,&mdash;<br />
"He called her in from me and shut the door!"<br />
</p>


<p class="center">III</p>

<p>
He called her in from me and shut the door!<br />
After long struggling with my pride and pain&mdash;<br />
A weary while it seemed, in which the more<br />
I held myself from her, the greater fain<br />
Was I to look upon her face again;&mdash;<br />
At last&mdash;at last&mdash;half conscious where my feet<br />
Were faring, I stood waist-deep in the sweet<br />
Green grasses there where she<br />
First came to me.&mdash;<br />
The very blossoms she had plucked that day,<br />
And, at her father's voice, had cast away,<br />
Around me lay,<br />
Still bright and blooming in these eyes of mine;<br />
And as I gathered each one eagerly,<br />
I pressed it to my lips and drank the wine<br />
Her kisses left there for the honey-bee.<br />
Then, after I had laid them with the tress<br />

<p>Of her bright hair with lingering tenderness,<br />
I, turning, crept on to the hedge that bound<br />
Her pleasant-seeming home&mdash;but all around<br />
Was never sign of her!&mdash;The windows all<br />
Were blinded; and I heard no rippling fall<br />
Of her glad laugh, nor any harsh voice call;&mdash;<br />
But clutching to the tangled grasses, caught<br />
A sound as though a strong man bowed his head<br />
And sobbed alone&mdash;unloved&mdash;uncomforted!&mdash;<br />
And then straightway before<br />
My tearless eyes, all vividly, was wrought<br />
A vision that is with me evermore:&mdash;<br />
A little girl that lies asleep, nor hears<br />
Nor heeds not any voice nor fall of tears.&mdash;<br />
And I sit singing o'er and o'er and o'er,&mdash;<br />
"God called her in from him and shut the door!"<br />

I touched her girlish hand, nor dared upraise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mine eyes, such was my faint heart's sweet distress.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then silence: And the perfume of her dress:</span><br />
The room will sway a little, and a haze<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cloy eyesight&mdash;soulsight, even&mdash;for a space:</span><br />
And tears&mdash;yes; and the ache here in the throat,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To know that I so ill deserve the place</span><br />
Her arms make for me; and the sobbing note<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I stay with kisses, ere the tearful face</span><br />

And let her diadem be wrought<br />
Of kindly deed and prayerful thought,<br />
That ever over all distress<br />
May beam the light of cheerfulness.&mdash;<br />
And let her feet be brave to fare<br />
The labyrinths of doubt and care,<br />
That, following, my own may find<br />
The path to Heaven God designed.&mdash;<br />
O let her come like this to me&mdash;<br />
My bride&mdash;my bride that is to be.<br />

I got to thinkin' of her&mdash;both her parents dead and gone&mdash;<br />
And all her sisters married off, and none but her and John<br />
A-livin' all alone there in that lonesome sort o' way,<br />
And him a blame old bachelor, confirmder ev'ry day!<br />
I'd knowed 'em all from childern, and their daddy from the time<br />
He settled in the neighberhood, and hadn't airy a dime<br />
Er dollar, when he married, fer to start housekeepin' on!&mdash;<br />
So I got to thinkin' of her&mdash;both her parents dead and gone!<br />
<br />
I got to thinkin' of her; and a-wundern what she done<br />
That all her sisters kep' a-gittin' married, one by one,<br />
And her without no chances&mdash;and the best girl of the pack&mdash;<br />
An old maid, with her hands, you might say, tied behind her back!<br />
And Mother, too, afore she died, she ust to jes' take on,<br />
When none of 'em was left, you know, but Evaline and John,<br />
And jes' declare to goodness 'at the young men must be bline<br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"> [Pg 96]</a></span>
To not see what a wife they'd git if they got Evaline!<br />
<br />
I got to thinkin' of her; in my great affliction she<br />
Was sich a comfert to us, and so kind and neighberly,&mdash;<br />
She'd come, and leave her housework, fer to he'p out little Jane,<br />
And talk of <i>her own</i> mother 'at she'd never see again&mdash;<br />
Maybe sometimes cry together&mdash;though, fer the most part she<br />
Would have the child so riconciled and happy-like 'at we<br />
Felt lonesomer 'n ever when she'd put her bonnet on<br />
And say she'd railly haf to be a-gittin' back to John!<br />
<br />
I got to thinkin' of her, as I say,&mdash;and more and more<br />
I'd think of her dependence, and the burdens 'at she bore,&mdash;<br />
Her parents both a-bein' dead, and all her sisters gone<br />
And married off, and her a-livin' there alone with John&mdash;<br />
You might say jes' a-toilin' and a-slavin' out her life<br />
Fer a man 'at hadn't pride enough to git hisse'f a wife&mdash;<br />
'Less some one married <i>Evaline</i> and packed her off some day!&mdash;<br />
So I got to thinkin' of her&mdash;and it happened thataway.<br />

Illileo, the moonlight seemed lost across the vales&mdash;<br />
The stars but strewed the azure as an armor's scattered scales;<br />
The airs of night were quiet as the breath of silken sails;<br />
And all your words were sweeter than the notes of nightingales.<br />
<br />
Illileo Legardi, in the garden there alone,<br />
With your figure carved of fervor, as the Psyche carved of stone,<br />
There came to me no murmur of the fountain's undertone<br />
So mystically, musically mellow as your own.<br />
<br />
You whispered low, Illileo&mdash;so low the leaves were mute,<br />
And the echoes faltered breathless in your voice's vain pursuit;<br />
And there died the distant dalliance of the serenader's lute:<br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"> [Pg 112]</a></span>
And I held you in my bosom as the husk may hold the fruit.<br />
<br />
Illileo, I listened. I believed you. In my bliss,<br />
What were all the worlds above me since I found you thus in this?&mdash;<br />
Let them reeling reach to win me&mdash;even Heaven I would miss,<br />
Grasping earthward!&mdash;I would cling here, though I clung by just a kiss!<br />
<br />
And blossoms should grow odorless&mdash;and lilies all aghast&mdash;<br />
And I said the stars should slacken in their paces through the vast,<br />
Ere yet my loyalty should fail enduring to the last.&mdash;<br />
So vowed I. It is written. It is changeless as the past.<br />
<br />
Illileo Legardi, in the shade your palace throws<br />
Like a cowl about the singer at your gilded porticos,<br />
A moan goes with the music that may vex the high repose<br />
Of a heart that fades and crumbles as the crimson of a rose.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Touches of your splendid lips,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the kiss that drips and drips!</span><br />
<br />
Ah, you pale at last!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And your face is lifted</span><br />
Like a white sail to the blast,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And your hands are shifted</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Into fists: and, towering thus,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">You are simply glorious!</span><br />
<br />
Now before me looms<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Something more than human;</span><br />
Something more than beauty blooms<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the wrath of Woman&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Something to bow down before</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Reverently and adore.</span><br />

<p>
It's a mystery to see me&mdash;a man o' fifty-four,<br />
Who's lived a cross old bachelor fer thirty year' and  more&mdash;<br />
A-lookin' glad and smilin'! And they's none o' you can say<br />
That you can guess the reason why I feel so good to-day!<br />
<br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"> [Pg 168]</a></span>
I must tell you all about it! But I'll have to deviate<br />
A little in beginnin', so's to set the matter straight<br />
As to how it comes to happen that I never took a wife&mdash;<br />
Kind o' "crawfish" from the Present to the Springtime of my life!<br />
<br />
I was brought up in the country: Of a family of five&mdash;<br />
Three brothers and a sister&mdash;I'm the only one alive,&mdash;<br />
Fer they all died little babies; and 'twas one o' Mother's ways,<br />
You know, to want a daughter; so she took a girl to raise.<br />
<br />
The sweetest little thing she was, with rosy cheeks, and fat&mdash;<br />
We was little chunks o' shavers then about as high as that!<br />
But someway we sort o' <i>suited</i>-like! and Mother she'd declare<br />
She never laid her eyes on a more lovin' pair<br />
<br />
Than <i>we</i> was! So we growed up side by side fer thirteen year',<br />
And every hour of it she growed to me more dear!&mdash;<br />
W'y, even Father's dyin', as he did, I do believe<br />
Warn't more affectin' to me than it was to see her grieve!<br />
<br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"> [Pg 169]</a></span>
I was then a lad o' twenty; and I felt a flash o' pride<br />
In thinkin' all depended on <i>me</i> now to pervide<br />
Fer Mother and fer Mary; and I went about the place<br />
With sleeves rolled up&mdash;and workin', with a mighty smilin' face.&mdash;<br />
<br />
Fer <i>sompin' else</i> was workin'! but not a word I said<br />
Of a certain sort o' notion that was runnin' through my head,&mdash;<br />
"Someday I'd mayby marry, and <i>a brother's</i> love was one<br />
Thing&mdash;<i>a lover's</i> was another!" was the way the notion run!<br />
<br />
I remember onc't in harvest, when the "cradle-in'" was done&mdash;<br />
When the harvest of my summers mounted up to twenty-one<br />
I was ridin' home with Mary at the closin' o' the day&mdash;<br />
A-chawin' straws and thinkin', in a lover's lazy way!<br />
<br />
And Mary's cheeks was burnin' like the sunset down the lane:<br />
I noticed she was thinkin', too, and ast her to explain.<br />
Well&mdash;when she turned and <i>kissed</i> me, <i>with her arms around me&mdash;law!</i><br />
I'd a bigger load o' heaven than I had a load o' straw!<br />
<br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"> [Pg 170]</a></span>
I don't p'tend to learnin', but I'll tell you what's a fact,<br />
They's a mighty truthful sayin' somers in a' almanack&mdash;<br />
Er <i>somers</i>&mdash;'bout "puore happiness"&mdash;perhaps some folks'll laugh<br />
At the idy&mdash;"only lastin' jest two seconds and a half."&mdash;<br />
<br />
But it's jest as true as preachin'!&mdash;fer that was <i>a sister's</i> kiss,<br />
And a sister's lovin' confidence a-tellin' to me this:&mdash;<br />
"<i>She</i> was happy, <i>bein' promised to the son o' farmer Brown</i>."&mdash;<br />
And my feelin's struck a pardnership with sunset and went down!<br />
<br />
I don't know <i>how</i> I acted&mdash;I don't know <i>what</i> I said,<br />
Fer my heart seemed jest a-turnin' to an ice-cold lump o' lead;<br />
And the hosses kindo' glimmered before me in the road.<br />
And the lines fell from my fingers&mdash;and that was all I knowed&mdash;<br />
<br />
Fer&mdash;well, I don't know <i>how</i> long&mdash;They's a dim rememberence<br />
Of a sound o' snortin' hosses, and a stake-and-ridered fence<br />
A-whizzin' past, and wheat-sheaves a-dancin' in the air,<br />
And Mary screamin' "Murder!" and a-runnin' up to  where<br />

<p><i>I</i> was layin' by the roadside, and the wagon upside down<br />
A-leanin' on the gate-post, with the wheels a whirlin' round!<br />
And I tried to raise and meet her, but I couldn't, with a vague<br />
Sorto' notion comin' to me that I had a broken leg.<br />
<br />
Well, the women nussed me through it; but many a time I'd sigh<br />
As I'd keep a-gittin' better instid o' goin' to die,<br />
And wonder what was left <i>me</i> worth livin' fer below,<br />
When the girl I loved was married to another, don't you know!<br />
<br />
And my thoughts was as rebellious as the folks was good and kind<br />
When Brown and Mary married&mdash;Railly must a-been my <i>mind</i><br />
Was kindo' out o' kilter!&mdash;fer I hated Brown, you see,<br />
Worse'n <i>pizen</i>&mdash;and the feller whittled crutches out fer <i>me</i>&mdash;<br />
<br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"> [Pg 174]</a></span>
And done a thousand little ac's o' kindness and respect&mdash;<br />
And me a-wishin' all the time that I could break his neck!<br />
My relief was like a mourner's when the funeral is done<br />
When they moved to Illinois in the Fall o' Forty-one.<br />
<br />
Then I went to work in airnest&mdash;I had nothin' much in view<br />
But to drown'd out rickollections&mdash;and it kep' me busy, too!<br />
But I slowly thrived and prospered, tel Mother used to say<br />
She expected yit to see me a wealthy man some day.<br />
<br />
Then I'd think how little <i>money</i> was, compared to happiness&mdash;<br />
And who'd be left to use it when I died I couldn't guess!<br />
But I've still kep' speculatin' and a-gainin' year by year,<br />
Tel I'm pay-in' half the taxes in the county, mighty near!<br />
<br />
Well!&mdash;A year ago er better, a letter comes to hand<br />
Astin' how I'd like to dicker fer some Illinois land&mdash;<br />
"The feller that had owned it," it went ahead to state,<br />
"Had jest deceased, insolvent, leavin' chance to speculate,"&mdash;<br />
<br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"> [Pg 175]</a></span>
And then it closed by sayin' that I'd "better come and see."&mdash;<br />
I'd never been West, anyhow&mdash;a most too wild fer <i>me</i><br />
I'd allus had a notion; but a lawyer here in town<br />
Said I'd find myself mistakened when I come to look around.<br />
<br />
So I bids good-bye to Mother, and I jumps aboard the train,<br />
A-thinkin' what I'd bring her when I come back home again&mdash;<br />
And ef she'd had an idy what the present was to be,<br />
I think it's more'n likely she'd a-went along with me!<br />
<br />
Cars is awful tejus ridin', fer all they go so fast!<br />
But finally they called out my stoppin'-place at last;<br />
And that night, at the tavern, I dreamp' <i>I</i> was a train<br />
O' cars, and <i>skeered</i> at sompin', runnin' down a country lane!<br />
<br />
Well, in the mornin' airly&mdash;after huntin' up the man&mdash;<br />
The lawyer who was wantin' to swap the piece o' land&mdash;<br />
We started fer the country; and I ast the history<br />
Of the farm&mdash;its former owner&mdash;and so-forth, etcetery!<br />
<br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"> [Pg 176]</a></span>
And&mdash;well&mdash;it was inte<i>rest</i>in'&mdash;I su-prised him, I suppose,<br />
By the loud and frequent manner in which I blowed my nose!&mdash;<br />
But his su-prise was greater, and it made him wonder more,<br />
When I kissed and hugged the widder when she met us at the door!&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>It was Mary</i>: They's a feelin' a-hidin' down in here&mdash;<br />
Of course I can't explain it, ner ever make it clear.&mdash;<br />
It was with us in that meetin', I don't want you to fergit!<br />
And it makes me kind o' nervous when I think about it yit!<br />
<br />
I <i>bought</i> that farm, and <i>deeded</i> it, afore I left the town,<br />
With "title clear to mansions in the skies," to Mary Brown!<br />
And fu'thermore, I took her and <i>the childern</i>&mdash;fer, you see,<br />
They'd never seed their Grandma&mdash;and I fetched 'em home with me.<br />
<br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"> [Pg 177]</a></span>

And hid in the leaves in wait for me.<br />
<br />
The humming-bird, like a courtier gay,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dipped down with a dalliant song,</span><br />
And twanged his wings through the roundelay<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of love the whole day long:</span><br />
Yet my rose turned from his minstrelsy<br />
And hid in the leaves in wait for me.<br />
<br />
The firefly came in the twilight dim<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My red, red rose to woo&mdash;</span><br />
Till quenched was the flame of love in him<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the light of his lantern too,</span><br />
As my rose wept with dewdrops three<br />
And hid in the leaves in wait for me.<br />
<br />
And I said: I will cull my own sweet rose&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some day I will claim as mine</span><br />
The priceless worth of the flower that knows<br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"> [Pg 180]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No change, but a bloom divine&mdash;</span><br />
The bloom of a fadeless constancy<br />
That hides in the leaves in wait for me!<br />
<br />
But time passed by in a strange disguise,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I marked it not, but lay</span><br />
In a lazy dream, with drowsy eyes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till the summer slipped away,</span><br />
And a chill wind sang in a minor key:<br />
"Where is the rose that waits for thee?"
</p>

<p class="center">* * *</p>

<p>I dream to-day, o'er a purple stain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of bloom on a withered stalk,</span><br />
Pelted down by the autumn rain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the dust of the garden-walk,</span><br />
That an Angel-rose in the world to be<br />
Will hide in the leaves in wait for me.<br />

Has she forgotten? On this very May<br />
We were to meet here, with the birds and bees,<br />
As on that Sabbath, underneath the trees<br />
We strayed among the tombs, and stripped away<br />
The vines from these old granites, cold and gray&mdash;<br />
And yet indeed not grim enough were they<br />
To stay our kisses, smiles and ecstasies,<br />
Or closer voice-lost vows and rhapsodies.<br />
Has she forgotten&mdash;that the May has won<br />
Its promise?&mdash;that the bird-songs from the tree<br />
Are sprayed above the grasses as the sun<br />
Might jar the dazzling dew down showeringly?<br />
Has she forgotten life&mdash;love&mdash;everyone&mdash;<br />
Has she forgotten me&mdash;forgotten me?<br />

Low, low down in the violets I press<br />

Just as of old, save for the tearfulness<br />
<br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"> [Pg 182]</a></span>
Of the clenched eyes, and the soul's vast distress?<br />

That made our breath a quickened atmosphere<br />
That failed nigh unto swooning with the sheer<br />
Delight? Mine arms clutch now this earthen heap<br />
Sodden with tears that flow on ceaselessly<br />
As autumn rains the long, long, long nights weep<br />
In memory of days that used to be,&mdash;<br />
Has she forgotten these? And in her sleep,<br />
Has she forgotten me&mdash;forgotten me?<br />

<p>
To-night, against my pillow, with shut eyes,<br />
I mean to weld our faces&mdash;through the dense<br />
Incalculable darkness make pretense<br />
That she has risen from her reveries<br />
To mate her dreams with mine in marriages<br />
Of mellow palms, smooth faces, and tense ease<br />
Of every longing nerve of indolence,&mdash;<br />
Lift from the grave her quiet lips, and stun<br />
My senses with her kisses&mdash;drawl the glee<br />
Of her glad mouth, full blithe and tenderly,<br />
Across mine own, forgetful if is done<br />
The old love's awful dawn-time when said we,<br />
"To-day is ours!"... Ah, Heaven! can it be<br />
She has forgotten me&mdash;forgotten me!<br />

Moaned over sleepless nights, kissed and caressed<br />

How sweet the sunlight on the garden wall<br />

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

1.E.9.

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
